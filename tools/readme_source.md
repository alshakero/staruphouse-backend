## Development

### Running the app

To run this app, you need to clone this repository and in its DIR do:

1. `yarn` or `npm i`.
2. `yarn start`.

The app will listen on port 3000 by default.

### Testing the solution

To run the tests, assuming you already did `yarn` or `npm`i, all you need to do is to run `yarn test` or `npm run test`.

### Technologies used

1. I used [`lowdb`](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) as database for simplicity.
2. I used [`node-fetch`](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) for easy promisified HTTP requests.
3. I cached exchange rates for 1 hour.
4. I cached zombie items for the whole 24h of their lifespan.
5. I used [`supertest`](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to test the API.
6. I used [`mocha`](https://mochajs.org/#installation) for assertions and general testing.

### Note on building docs

_Please do not modify this file manually. It's automatically generated by running `npm run build-docs`. To modify it, you can either edit `tools/readme_source.md` or route descriptions under `apiActions` directory._

### Feedback

Please note that the `/today` endpoint of NBP doesn't work on bank holidays as transfer rates are not updated. I had to use `https://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/tables/C/?format=json` endpoint instead. It returns the latest available exchange rates.
