## Development

### Running the app

To run this app, you need to clone this repository and in its DIR do:

1. `yarn` or `npm i`.
2. `yarn start` or `npm run start`.

The app will listen on port 3000 by default.

### Testing the solution

To run the tests, assuming you already did `yarn` or `npm i`, all you need to do is to run `yarn test` or `npm run test`.

#### Testing coverage 
- *Integration tests*: I tested against every supported endpoint disregarding implentation details.
- *Unit tests*: I tested every validation function in `apiActions/validators.js`. 

I didn't test `DBManager` class because it is tested fairly enough in the integeration tests, especially given the limited time for the project.

##### Note: Running the tests resets the DB to its default state. 

### Technologies used

1. I used [`lowdb`](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) as database for simplicity.
2. I used [`node-fetch`](https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch) for easy promisified HTTP requests.
3. I cached exchange rates for 1 hour.
4. I cached zombie items for the whole 24h of their lifespan.
5. I used [`supertest`](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to test the API.
6. I used [`mocha`](https://mochajs.org/#installation) for assertions and general testing.
7. I deployed on Zeit.

### Note on building docs

_Please do not modify this file manually. It's automatically generated by running `npm run build-docs`. To modify it, you can either edit `tools/readme_source.md` or route descriptions under `apiActions` directory._

### Note on data persistence
Due to Zeit limitations; deployments filesystem is not persistent. Which makes the DB I am using volatile. All data disappears when the instance goes to light-sleep mode. I didn't work on a remote DB because it seems to be it isn't the scope of the task and can be a waste of time.

### Pushing data easily to test 
I created this `curl` command to help you push a zombie with a few items without Postman's hassle or such.

```sh
curl 'http://localhost:3000/zombies' -H 'Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8' --data-binary '{"name":"Omar","items":[{"id":3,"name":"Wooden Hoe"},{"id":1,"name":"Diamond Sword"}]}'
```

### Feedback

Please note that the `/today` endpoint of NBP doesn't work on bank holidays as transfer rates are not updated. I had to use `https://api.nbp.pl/api/exchangerates/tables/C/?format=json` endpoint instead. It returns the latest available exchange rates.
